import { TestButton } from "@/components/TestButton";

# MDX Integration Test

This is a test post to verify MDX integration is working correctly.

## Interactive Component

Below is a React component imported and rendered in MDX:

<TestButton client:load />

## Markdown Features

All standard markdown features should still work:

- Lists work
- **Bold text** works
- *Italic text* works
- `Inline code` works

```javascript
// Code blocks work
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello from MDX!");
}
```

This confirms MDX is properly configured!
