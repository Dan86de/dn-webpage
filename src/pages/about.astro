          Hey, I'm Daniel Noworyta. For most of my life, I pushed aside my dream
          of becoming a programmer and doing what I love. In 2020, I fulfilled
          that dream and became a programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a channel on YouTube where I share my insights and experiences
          in learning programming, transitioning to new fields, and advancing my
          career in IT.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love dark mode and side projects. When I'm not working, I like
          playing football, reading books, and eating pizza.

    <h3 class="font-medium max-w-[675px] pb-6">My Story</h3>
    <Stack class="pb-8">
      <p>
        I used to live a life that, on the surface, looked successful but felt
        deeply unfulfilling. As a Class A surface modeler in the automotive
        industry, I spent my days working long hours in front of a computer,
        creating 3D models in specialized software. My routine was grueling:
        waking up at 6:00 AM, working from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and frequently
        traveling to production facilities in places like Detroit, Turin,
        Sweden, and Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        The constant delegations kept me away from home, which became unbearable
        when I met my wife and dreamed of starting a family. I felt trapped,
        knowing I’d hit the ceiling of my career with no room to grow or earn
        more, and my true passion—creating web pages and solving problems
        through coding—was just a distant dream I lacked the courage to pursue.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mindset back then was a mix of hope and frustration. I believed I
        could change my life, inspired by YouTube creators and tech blogs, but I
        wasn’t sure if I could pull it off. I felt excited about the possibility
        of becoming a software developer, yet the demands of my job and the fear
        of failure held me back.
      </p>
    </Stack>
    <h4 class="font-medium max-w-[675px] pb-6">My "rock bottom" moment</h4>
    <Stack class="pb-8">
      <p>
        The lowest point came when my son was born, and my company sent me to
        Detroit for a six-month project. Missing those precious early months
        with my newborn son was heartbreaking—it was my rock bottom. I knew I
        couldn’t keep living a life that kept me away from my family and my true
        calling. That moment, coupled with my desire to return to Poland and
        raise my son there, was the spark that pushed me to act.
      </p>
      <p>
        Determined to change my life, I committed to learning how to code. I
        started with online courses from Udemy and YouTube, focusing on HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript. To make progress, I reshaped my routine, waking up
        at 5:30 AM—or even 4:30 AM—to study before my 8-to-5 job, then coding
        again in the evenings. It wasn’t easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a self-taught developer, I faced imposter syndrome and struggled to
        find well-structured resources. I often redid courses multiple times to
        solidify my knowledge, and without a mentor, I had to rely on sheer
        persistence. But my dream of working from home, building a SaaS product,
        and achieving financial independence kept me going. After two and a half
        years of relentless effort, I landed my first job as a full-stack
        developer in the TypeScript ecosystem.

    <h4 class="font-medium max-w-[675px] pb-6">What I'm doing today</h4>
    <Stack class="mb-10">
      <p>
        Today, I work remotely for a German company, building applications for
        installers of heat pumps and gas boilers using React and React Native.
        With six years of professional coding experience, I earn a good living
        and have the freedom to be with my family in Poland. My life has
        transformed—I’m no longer tethered to constant travel or a career
        ceiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also run a YouTube channel with over 5,500 subscribers, where I share
        my coding journey and inspire others, recently switching to English to
        reach a broader audience. The key lesson I’ve learned is that with
        enough will and dedication, anyone can make a significant life change,
        no matter their circumstances. Two and a half years may seem long, but
        it’s a small price to pay for a lifetime of fulfillment.
      </p>
      <p>
        This journey fuels my current mission: to show others that they, too,
        can transform their lives by pursuing their passions, especially in the
        IT industry. In an era where AI is changing the landscape, I want to
        inspire people to embrace challenges, learn to code, and build careers
        that offer freedom and impact. My story is proof that with persistence,
        anyone can turn their dreams into reality.
